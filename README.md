# Stats230_Final_VAE

This is a directory for Stats 230 final report. The algorithm implemented are in this [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1312.6114.pdf). The main algorithm is SGVB. And we compare it with EM in approximating the 2 dimensional Gaussian distribution. 

The code is written in Python 3. The variational auto encoder is implemented in Keras (version 2.0.5) with tensorflow backend (version 1.2.0) and trained with GPU (Nvidia TITAN X Pascal) accelaration.
